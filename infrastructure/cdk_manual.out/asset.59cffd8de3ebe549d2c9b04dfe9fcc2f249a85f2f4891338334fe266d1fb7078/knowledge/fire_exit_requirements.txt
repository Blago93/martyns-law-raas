# UK Fire Exit Requirements (BS 5499-4:2013)

## What Constitutes a Legal Fire Exit

A fire exit in the UK MUST have:

1. **Green "Running Man" Sign** (BS 5499-4:2013)
   - Pictogram showing a person running towards a door
   - White symbol on green background
   - Illuminated or photoluminescent
   - Visible from all approach angles

2. **Directional Arrow** (if not immediately visible)
   - Points toward the exit route
   - Green background with white arrow

3. **"Fire Exit" or "Emergency Exit" Text** (optional but common)
   - Usually accompanies the running man symbol

4. **Push Bar or Panic Hardware** (for final exits)
   - Must open in direction of escape
   - No locks requiring keys from inside

5. **Clear, Unobstructed Path**
   - Minimum 750mm width for single person
   - No storage, furniture, or obstacles

## What is NOT a Fire Exit

- **Regular doors** without signage
- **Locked doors** requiring keys
- **Doors to cupboards, offices, or rooms**
- **Doors that open inward** (toward the room)
- **Unmarked exits** (even if they lead outside)

## Counter-Terrorism Considerations (Martyn's Law)

Fire exits present a security dilemma:
- **Must remain accessible** for emergency evacuation
- **Can be exploited** for hostile reconnaissance or unauthorized entry
- **Require monitoring** (CCTV, alarms) without impeding egress

### Reasonably Practicable Mitigations:
- Alarmed fire exits (sound when opened)
- CCTV coverage of exit routes
- Staff training on suspicious behavior
- Regular checks that exits are clear

### NOT Reasonably Practicable:
- Locking fire exits
- Removing fire exit signage
- Blocking exits with security barriers

## Assessment Guidance

When analyzing an image:
1. **Look for the green running man sign** - this is the definitive indicator
2. **Check for "Fire Exit" text** - secondary indicator
3. **Verify the door type** - push bars, panic hardware
4. **Assess the context** - does it lead to a corridor or outside?
5. **Do NOT assume** - a regular door is not a fire exit unless marked

**If no signage is visible, it is NOT a fire exit.**
